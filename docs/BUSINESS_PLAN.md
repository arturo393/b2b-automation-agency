# 💼 Business Plan: B2B Automation Agency

"We eliminate manual data entry in high-volume industries using Gemini-powered intelligent pipelines."

**The ROI Sales Pitch (Cost vs. Software):**
- **Current Human Cost**: 1 employee = ~$1,200 USD/mo. Can manually process ~3,000 documents per month (approx. 5 mins per doc). Error rate: ~2-5%.
- **B2B Automation Software Cost**: $500 USD/mo. Can process **100,000+ documents** 24/7/365. Error rate: <0.5%.
- **Result**: The client saves around 60% in direct costs while multiplying their operational capacity by 30x. This is not software; this is a "digital workforce."

## 2. Target Markets
1. **Customs Brokerages (Agencias de Aduana)**: standard invoices, BLs, trade forms.
2. **Logistics & Freight Forwarders**: delivery notes, POs.
3. **Fruit & Wine Exporters**: compliance docs, export certifications.
4. **GovTech (Public Sector)**: National and local government tenders for document digitization.

## 3. Revenue Model
- **Setup Fee ($XXXX)**: Initial configuration, ERP integration, and model fine-tuning for specific client documents.
- **SaaS Retainer ($XXX - $XXXX /mo)**: Monthly subscription covering API costs, maintenance, and a fixed quota of documents.
- **Project-Based (Government)**: Fixed-price contracts (licitaciones) for large-scale digitalization milestones.

## 4. Sales & Bidding Strategy
- **Private Sector (Hunters)**: Direct outreach via **The Hunter** (personalized emails + Proof of Work).
- **Public Sector (Bidding Agent)**: 
  - Monitoring of platforms (e.g., Mercado Público).
  - AI-assisted analysis of Technical Requirements (TR) to check compatibility.
  - Automated generation of technical proposal outlines.

## 5. Technical Integration Strategy (The "Last Mile")
Clients don't buy JSON; they buy updated databases. Our setups must offer "Last Mile" integration into local/global ERPs:
- **Global**: SAP, Oracle Netsuite, Microsoft Dynamics.
- **LatAm/Chile Local**: Softland, Defontana, Buk, Rex+.

## 6. Brand Authority & Professionalism
To sell $5,000+ B2B contracts, the agency's outward appearance must be flawless:
- **Corporate Domain**: Outreach emails must come from `@b2b-automation.com` (or similar), never `@gmail.com`.
- **LinkedIn Presence**: Founder profiles optimized for "AI Automation Consultancies" rather than "Freelance Developer".
